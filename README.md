# Tweeter

The idea of this exercise is to build upon the Tweeter project we
worked on in class.

In this assignment you'll work in groups to implement the following
features:

- **Direct messages**: There's a new table in the database,
  `messages`, that you'll need to use to implement direct messaging
  between users of Tweeter.  Direct messages are messages that a
  logged user sends to another user.
- **Search**: Create a new page that someone can use to search for
  tweets containing a particular word.

## Submission

Push your latest code by March 8th 22:00 GMT+1.  I'll only grade the
